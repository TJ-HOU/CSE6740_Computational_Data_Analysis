### 1. Support Vector Machine
* Explained that only the data points on the "margin" will play a role
### 2. Multi-class Classification
* Data set: MNIST database of handwritten digits with a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples
* Fine tuned classifiers using KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, kernel SVM, and Neural Network models
* Evaluated and compared the classifers using confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1 score
### 3. 
* Considered a simple two-layer network and find the gradient of the loss function with respect to its parameters
