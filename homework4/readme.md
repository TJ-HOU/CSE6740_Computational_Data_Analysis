## homework 4: Optimization and Classification [ report ] [ report ](https://github.com/sliao7/CSE6740_Computational_Data_Analysis/blob/main/homework4/Liao_Shasha_HW4_report.pdf) 
#### 1. Basic Optimization and Logistic Regression
* Studied the loss function of logistic regression model and proved that it is concave.
* Compared Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms.
#### 2. Classification [ code ](https://github.com/sliao7/CSE6740_Computational_Data_Analysis/blob/main/homework4/python/classifier.py)
* Built three classifiers **Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN** to predict marital status ("divorce" or "no divorce") and visualized the decision boundaries.
* Applied the three classifiers to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST data and visualized the decision boundaries. 
#### 3. Naive Bayes for spam filtering
* Trained a Naive Bayes for spam filtering by hand.
* Classified a test message using the Naive Bayes classfier.
