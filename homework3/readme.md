## homework 3: Density Estimation [ report ](https://github.com/sliao7/CSE6740_Computational_Data_Analysis/blob/main/homework3/Shasha_Liao_HW3_report.pdf) 
### 1. Kernel Density Estimation on psychological experiments [ code ](https://github.com/sliao7/CSE6740_Computational_Data_Analysis/blob/main/homework3/python/density_estimation.py)
* Studied whether or not the two brain regions are likely to be independent of each other on a psychological experiment dataset.
* Applied 1D and 2D kernel density estimations and visualized the results.
* Conlusion: people with less extreme political views have their two regions functions more independently than those with extreme political views.
### 2. EM algorithm for MNIST dataset [ code ](https://github.com/sliao7/CSE6740_Computational_Data_Analysis/blob/main/homework3/python/EM_scipy.py)
* Implemented the EM algorithm for fitting a Gaussion mixture model for the MNIST dataset with 1990 images.
* Performed PCA to reduce the dimension of the data into 5 before applying EM.
* Compared results from EM algorithm (miss-classification rate = 3.27%) with results from K-means clustering (miss-classification rate = 5.93%).
